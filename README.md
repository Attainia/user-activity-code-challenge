# vue-example

Implemented as reusable component to reduce repetitive code. Each route defines the CSS to apply and a compute function to determine which users get the highlight class. The component toggles a class on the parent element for performance reasons (smaller DOM update).

Backend is implemented in Node, because I'm not a python (Django) developer.
